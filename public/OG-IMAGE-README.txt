OPEN GRAPH IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

To improve social media sharing, add an Open Graph image:

1. Create or design an image that is 1200x630 pixels
2. Save it as 'og-image.png' in this directory (public/)
3. The image should showcase your Image Tiler app
4. Recommended content:
   - App name: "Visual Image Tiler"
   - Brief tagline: "Create Seamless Textures Online"
   - Example before/after of a texture
   - Clean, professional design

The image is already referenced in app/layout.tsx and will automatically
appear when sharing your site on:
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- Twitter/X
- Discord
- Slack
- And other platforms supporting Open Graph

Tips:
- Use high contrast for readability
- Include your brand colors
- Make text large enough to read in thumbnails
